In showing a long lists, sometimes one would prefer to see the value
arranged aligned in columns. Some examples include listing methods of an
object, listing debugger commands, or showing a numeric array with data
aligned.

This is a Python module to format a simple (i.e. not nested) list into
aligned columns. A string with embedded newline characters is returned.

Setup
-----

.. code:: python

    $ python
    >>> import columnize

With String data
----------------

Each column is only as wide as necessary. By default, columns are
separated by two spaces; one was not legible enough. Set *colsep* to
adjust the string separate columns. Set *displaywidth* to set the line
width.

.. code:: python

    >>> g = ('bibrons', 'golden', 'madascar', 'leopard', 'mourning', 'suras', 'tokay')
    >>> print(columnize.columnize(g, displaywidth=15))
    bibrons   suras
    golden    tokay
    madascar
    leopard
    mourning

    >>> print(columnize.columnize(g, displaywidth=19, colsep=' | '))
    bibrons  | mourning
    golden   | suras
    madascar | tokay
    leopard

    >>> print(columnize.columnize(g, displaywidth=18, colsep=' | ', ljust=False))
    bibrons | suras
     golden | tokay
    madascar
     leopard

Normally, consecutive items go down from the top to bottom from the
left-most column to the right-most. If *arrange\_vertical* is set false,
consecutive items will go across, left to right, top to bottom.

With numeric data
-----------------

.. code:: python

    >>> print(columnize.columnize(['1', '2', '3', '4'], displaywidth=6)) # => '1  3\n2  4\n'
    1  3
    2  4

    >>> print(columnize.columnize(list(range(1,6)), displaywidth=8))
    1  3  5
    2  4

By default entries are left justified:

.. code:: python

    >>>  print(columnize.columnize(list(range(1,16)), displaywidth=10))

    1  6   11
    2  7   12
    3  8   13
    4  9   14
    5  10  15

but you can change that with *ljust* or if *arrange\_array* is set to
*True*:

.. code:: python

    >>>  print(columnize.columnize(list(range(1,16)), displaywidth=10, ljust=False))
    1   6  11
    2   7  12
    3   8  13
    4   9  14
    5  10  15

    >>> print(columnize.columnize(list(range(1,5)), opts={'arrange_array':True, 'displaywidth':6}))
    [1, 2
     3, 4]

This module (essentially one function) was adapted from a private method
of the same name from Python s
`cmd <https://docs.python.org/library/cmd.html>`__ module. Some
adjustments and generalizations have been made.
